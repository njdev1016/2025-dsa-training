# DSA Training Plan v3 - GKG Pattern-Based (4 Weeks)

**Source:** `./gkg-code-interview-patterns/` (Gkg the Coding Interview)
**Total Patterns:** 16 | **Total Problems:** 85+ core + 30+ challenges
**Time Commitment:** 4 weeks, 4-5 hours/day

## Training Philosophy

This plan follows the **pattern-recognition approach** to coding interviews. Instead of solving random problems, you'll master specific patterns that can be applied to hundreds of interview questions. Each pattern has a template/framework that you'll internalize through practice.

## Success Strategies

### Pattern Recognition Framework:
1. **Read the problem** - Identify key constraints
2. **Ask questions:**
   - Is the input sorted? → Binary Search, Two Pointers
   - Do I need all combinations? → Subsets, Backtracking
   - Is it about K elements? → Top K, Heaps
   - Is it about cycles? → Fast/Slow Pointers
   - Is it about intervals? → Merge Intervals
   - Is it about trees/graphs? → BFS/DFS
3. **Apply template** - Use the pattern's standard approach
4. **Optimize** - Consider edge cases and time/space trade-offs

### Time Complexity Targets:
- **Easy:** Solve in < 15 minutes
- **Medium:** Solve in < 30 minutes
- **Hard:** Solve in < 45 minutes

### When Stuck (Max 20 minutes):
1. Review pattern theory (5 min)
2. Look at similar solved problems (5 min)
3. Check one hint (5 min)
4. If still stuck, view solution explanation (5 min)
5. **Always re-implement from scratch** without looking

4. **Handle edge cases** - Empty inputs, single elements, duplicates
5. **Ask clarifying questions** - Don't make assumptions
6. **Practice on whiteboard** - Not just in IDE
7. **Time management** - Don't spend > 5 minutes stuck on one thing
8. **Stay calm** - It's okay to ask for hints
